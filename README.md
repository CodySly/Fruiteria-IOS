Welcome to the Fruiteria iOS App, a mobile application designed for the "Fruiteria" ice cream shop. This app allows customers to explore a variety of products from two locations. Whether you're a developer looking to contribute or a user interested in using the app, you'll find all the information you need in this README.

**Disclaimer this app at one time was to be a full production application. As I was taking the CS50x course I decided to talk to a friend of mine at the time owned "Fruiteria". I asked if I could create an app to provided an helping service to the company with customer confusion on products offered, by giving a description and prices. In the end I was looking to create a fully functional online ordering application for Fruiteria exclusively.

  Due to unfortunate circumstances within the company themselves they have decided to go a different route and has put a hault to any further help or discussion on development of this application. I was not being paid nor did I create any contract with the applications development. My purpose was to use this as my Final project for the CS50x course as well as provided a friend with a helping service. For now any further progress on this app has been stopped as of 10/31/23. Currently the app is fuctional giving a image, price and name of each flavor of ice and other products offered by Fruiteria.
